# Entanglement properties in QFT and Holography

This reading club mainly consists of junior graduate students in KITS. In 2023 fall, we'll discuss various topics in the landscape of quantum entanglement and quantum information, and to understand them in the context of quantum field theories and holography.

We plan to have a general introduction first, and follow up with discussions on several topics that are currently concerned by the community.




## Goal

- learn the basic ideas and toolbox for studying quantum information & entanglement structures
- have basic knowledge of their progresses on QFT & holography
- able to do some calculations via learning some concrete examples 
- promote reading papers and presentation skills



## Topics

- general introduction: [Lectures on entanglement entropy in field theory and
  holography](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08126) 

- vN algebra:

  1. some mathematical ideas of entanglement in QFT - [Notes On Some Entanglement Properties Of Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04993) 
  2. vN algebra for physicist - [Notes on the type classification of von Neumann algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01958) 
  3. vN algebra in quantum gravity - [Gravity and the crossed product](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12828) 
  4. applications in generalized entanglement entropy - [Large *N* algebras and generalized entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10454)
